# Airprobe

Airprobe is my senior project, which is final project for ECE497(Undergraduate senior design course) in UIC. It's a multimeter wirelessly transmit data through Bluetooth to mobile devices.

This repo contains the source code for Airprobe, which is built on Flutter. And we adopt other third party flutter plugins, [Chart](https://github.com/google/charts), [flutter_blue](https://github.com/pauldemarco/flutter_blue).
